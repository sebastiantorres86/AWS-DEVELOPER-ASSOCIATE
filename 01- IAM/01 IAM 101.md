# Identity Access Management 101

## What is IAM?

Essentially, IAM allows you to manage users and their level of access to the AWS Console. It is important to understand IAM and how it works, both for the exam and for administrating a company's AWS account in real life.

## What does IAM give you?

- Centralized control of your AWS account.
- Shared Access to your AWS account.
- Granular Permissions.
- Indentity Federation (including Active Directory, Facebook, LinkedIn, etc.).
- Multifactor Authentication.
- Provides temporary access for users/devices and services, as necessary.
- Allows you to set up your own password rotation policy.
- Integrates with many different AWS services.
- Support PCI DSS Compliance.

## Critical terms:

- Users - End Users (think people).
- Groups - A collection of users under one set of permissions.
- Roles - You create roles and can then assign them to AWS resources.
- Policies - A document that defines one (or more) permissions.
